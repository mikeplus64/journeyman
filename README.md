# Journeyman

An eDSL for creating tournaments. Use it as a library in a project that uses
tournaments.

# Development setup

You can set up a development environment with journeyman by using
[Nix](https://nixos.org/).

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com:mikeplus64/journeyman.git
$ cd journeyman
$ nix develop
```

Linux and macOS should work easily enough.
