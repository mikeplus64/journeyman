  + Contrast between creating tournaments, and analysis of them
  + Options
    - Property based testing - monte carlo simulation thing

- Need to have a formal list of what sorts of tournaments need to be supported
  + N-ary elim
  + Round robin
  + Forfeits
  + Cutoffs, *asymmetric* cut
    - Tiebreakers
    - Use seed value
