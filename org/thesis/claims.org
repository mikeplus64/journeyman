** DONE What is the motivation for starting the project?
*** DONE What is my relevant background?
** DONE Why are tournaments important?
*** DONE Economics of tournaments
** DONE Why is fairness of tournaments important?
*** DONE Are existing tournaments fair?

** DONE What is the contribution and scope of the project?

* DONE Literature Review
** DONE DSLs
** DONE Tournaments
** DONE Sorting networks

* TODO Design and implementation
** DONE What goals are there for the library?
*** DONE Small number of primitives
*** DONE <=> Ease of use
*** DONE <=> Ease of analysis
*** DONE Composability of tournaments to create novel new ones

** DONE What process was undergone to create the final design?
*** DONE What changed over the course of the project?

** TODO What is the core of the library?
*** DONE What capability does this design give?
*** TODO What limitations are there?
**** DONE Which tournaments are sorting networks, and what aren't?
**** DONE How do we accommodate tournaments that are not sorting networks?
***** DONE Are there tournaments that are static, but not sorting networks?

** DONE What is the syntax of the eDSL?

** DONE What are some examples of tournaments built using the eDSL?
*** DONE Single elimination
*** DONE Double elimination
*** DONE Round-Robin

** TODO How can tournaments built with the eDSL be ran?
** TODO How can analysis of tournaments be done using this structure?
*** TODO Pure subsets of tournaments

* TODO Analysis
** TODO How do tournament structures compare?
*** TODO Resistance to false seeding / Elo preservation
**** Give a tournament with N rank inversions in the initial seeding, see how many rank inversions remain after
*** TODO Resource use / number of parallel games
*** TODO Number of rank inversions
*** TODO Rematch avoidance
*** TODO Length
*** Fairness
*** Competitive Integrity
*** Equal Rank Difference

*** Equal Gap Seeding outside of a deterministic domain
